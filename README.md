# Assignment 2 - Landing Page

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to add dynamic elements to an otherwise static website using JavaScript.
The following functionality has been added with JS:
- **Dynamic NAV creation**: NAV items are auto-generated based on the sections contained within the main tag.
- **Active section highlight**: The Intersection Observer API was utilized to determine the user's position on the page and to toggle active states on sections and the NAV when appropriate.
- **Sticky NAV**: The navbar portion of the header remains sticky when scrolling in order to facilitate easier navigation.
